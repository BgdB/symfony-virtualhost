# B-scripts

## About

There is a collection of bash scripts with commands that we boringly run to configure a virtual host and install symfony projects and other stuff. 

### NVH - New Virtual Host

It helps you to easly create a new host for a Symfony project. Just run it with no parameters and go with the flow.

### HCL - Host Cleaner

Basically, you don't want to run this script. It deletes all the virtual hosts from `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/` which are not listed in `/etc/hosts`.
